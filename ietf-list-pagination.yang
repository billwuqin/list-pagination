    "This module is used by servers to indicate they support
     pagination on 'list' and 'leaf-list' resources, as well
     as provide a mechanism whereby servers may indicate
     which 'config false' lists have constrained 'where'
     filters, as well as which of their descendent nodes
     may be used in the 'where' filters.
